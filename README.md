# Recommendation System

This is a recommendation system that uses collaborative filtering to recommend movies to users. The system uses the MovieLens dataset, which contains 25M ratings .
The project explores different recommendation algorithms: Content-based, User-based collaborative filtering, Item-based collaborative filtering.
We also worked on singular value decomposition (SVD) and matrix factorization to improve the recommendation system.
